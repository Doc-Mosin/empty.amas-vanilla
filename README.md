How to use the mission?
Download. Rename empty.amas-main folder to empty.amas and copy it to your mpmission folder in your DayZ server.
More files are not required for a vanilla server.

This mission is intended for Vanilla. The Full mission for mods you can be found here: https://github.com/Doc-Mosin/empty.amas

I only host the vanilla mission on my github account for my Amas server.

All rights to the map and mission are owned by AlexTrust ( https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197999988745 ), who offers the Amas map for free in the DayZ workshop. Thank You!
